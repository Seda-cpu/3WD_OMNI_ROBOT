# 3WD_OMNI_ROBOT

In this project I made SLAM with 3WD Onidirectional Robot. The mobile robot chasis consists of 3 omni wheels spaced at 120 degrees apart. It is designed for indoor mapping by keeping maneuverability in the first place.
You can find the chasis in this link: https://www.nexusrobot.com/product/3wd-48mm-omni-wheel-robot-platform-chassiswith-encoderblack-15001b.html


For mapping, Hector SLAM and GMapping methods have been tried and compared.
Another unique aspect of the work is that it can be controlled via the WEB interface that I designed.

# SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping)

*The robot needs to map of its enviroment to determine the position and to know their own location to map the enviroment.*
